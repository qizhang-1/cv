\noindent {Dear Hiring manager,}

I earned my Ph.D. degree in Aerospace Engineering at the \emph{University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign} in May 2014 and I am very excited to forward my application for the position of \position at \company.    I believe that I possess the skills that the position demands and hence I am submitting my application.  

During my Ph.D. work, I worked closely with my advisor \emph{Prof.\,Daniel J.\,Bodony} in large scale numerical simulations of  fluid dynamics and aeroacoustics problems.   My Ph.D. dissertation mainly focuses on the flow features of the acoustic liners and I successfully performed the \textbf{first} direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a 3-D honeycomb acoustic liner under a turbulent boundary layer.  Detailed analysis of the simulation results uncovered many unknown features of the liners in their real working conditions.  The novel ideas in the thesis were highly appreciated by our technical monitors and research scientists at NASA Langley.    

I have extensive experience in writing computational fluid dynamics codes using different languages (C/C++, Fortran) for supercomputing environments (MPI). I've developed my own 2-D and 3-D Navier-Stokes equations solver.   I am  excellent at analytical modeling of the physical problems using my solid mathematics ground.   Based on these skills, I have authored 5 journal publications (including one published at \emph{Journal of Fluid Mechanics}), 6 conference papers and 4 bulletin abstracts.   I also gave more than 10 formal talks in different conference meetings including \emph{American Physics Society} (APS) and \emph{American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics} (AIAA).  

Last year, I was deeply involved in the simulation of a high speed cross-in-jet for the proposal submission {Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program(II) (PSAAP II)} (funded by DOE) and eventually my university became one of the three Multidisciplinary Simulation Centers.  Moreover, I also performed DNS of a Mach 1.3 supersonic nozzle jet and transient subsonic turbulent jets.   Now I am working on the simulation and modeling of entropic noise sources in a single stage low-pressure turbine.    The experience acquired from these projects over the past few years has instilled in me the confidence in this position.  

I believe that my solid technical background and dedicated working attitude make me a unique candidate for this position.  I've enclosed my resume and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my credentials.     Thank you for your consideration.
