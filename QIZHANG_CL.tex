\noindent {Dear Hiring manager,}

I got my Ph.D. degree in Aerospace Engineering from \emph{University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign} in May 2014.    I am very excited to see there is a postdoc position available in the \company.   I am submitting the enclosed CV for my application to it.  

I worked closely with my advisor \emph{Prof.\,Daniel J.\,Bodony} in large scale numerical simulations of both fluid dynamics and aero-acoustics problems.   
My  Ph.D. dissertation mainly focuses on acoustic liners and I successfully performed the \textbf{first} direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a 3-D honeycomb acoustic liner under turbulent boundary layer.  Detailed analysis of the simulation results uncovered many unknown features of the liners in their real working conditions. Further, many of the novel ideas inside were highly appreciated by NASA senior research scientists.    

Last year, I was also deeply involved in the proposal simulation of a high speed hydrogen jet impinging into a turbulent boundary layer for the \emph{Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program (II)} (funded by DOE) and eventually helped my university to become one of the three Multidisciplinary Simulation Centers (MSC) in US.  Moreover, I also performed DNS of a Mach 1.3 supersonic nozzle jet and transient subsonic turbulent jets.   Through these different projects, I have developed strong confidence and interest in doing research independently.   

I have extensive experience in writing computational fluid dynamics codes using different languages (C, C++, Fortran) for supercomputing environments (MPI).  I am also excellent at analytical modeling of the physical problems using my solid mathematics ground.   Based on these skills, I have authored 3 journal publications (including one published at \emph{Journal of Fluid Mechanics}), 6 conference papers and 4 bulletin abstracts.   I also gave more than 10 formal talks in different conference meetings including \emph{American Physics Society}, \emph{American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics} etc.  Right now I am preparing for another 2 journal papers. 

I believe that my solid technical background and dedicated working attitude make me a unique candidate for this position.  I've enclosed my resume and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my credentials.   Please let me if you need additional information.   Thank you for your time and consideration.
