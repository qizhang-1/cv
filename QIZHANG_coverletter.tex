\noindent {Dear Hiring manager,}

I am currently working at Institute of Computational Sciences at the \emph{University of Texas at Austin}.   I am respectfully submitting the enclosed resume for my application to the \position position at \company.  

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Aerospace Engineering Department at the \emph{University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign} with a focus on large-scale parallel simulations in computational fluid dynamics.   I have extensive experience in writing large scale codes using different languages (Java, C, C++, Python and Fortran) for supercomputing environments when I was a Ph.D. student.  As a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin, I participated in developing, maintaining and implementing unit test for the SU2 code.   I never stopped learning after my Ph.D. graduation and continued to learn new things all the time.  I kept myself updated with the trend of objective oriented programming, large data manipulation and machine learning skills via Coursera.    I believe that my solid technical background and dedicated working attitude make me an ideal candidate for this position. 

 I've enclosed my resume and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my credentials.   Please let me if you need additional information.   Thank you for your time and consideration.
