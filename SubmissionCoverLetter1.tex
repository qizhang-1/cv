\noindent {To whom it may concern,}

I am writing to recommend Chang for admission into the masters in the management program at your prestigious university.   I started to know Chang from a math class.   I was a math tutor and she was my student.  
Through the whole summer, Chang has acquired a diverse educational background that has enabled her to accumulate advanced calculus principles, which can be applied in the master’s program. In addition, the knowledge she has acquired from the university can be used to transfer methodology of agriculture to the sustainable development of ecology and environments, solving the sustainability issues in agriculture. Chang’s grades have been admirably good and she has maintained these good grades all through her student life at the University. Besides the good grades, Chang has excellent writing skills and is very organized. With this educational background, I attest that Chang is qualified to attend the masters in the management program. 

Another aspect that Chang deeply attracts me is her ambitious in building up her family business.    Through our deep conversations, I started to know that Chang was born in a upper-class in the United States.   However, she never takes too much pride in what she owned.   Instead she studies hard and works very diligently.   Once she told me her parents had set up a great role model for her and she would never let them down.   She felt sorry for her parents that they  never had a chance to go to graduate school, which undoubtedly narrows their view in business.   Deep in her heart the modern ideas would be a key factor to successfully manage business in the future.   I strongly agree with her opinion.

I, therefore, highly recommend Chang to the committee of the graduate school. Please feel free to contact me at any point  if you have any questions regarding this recommendation.
