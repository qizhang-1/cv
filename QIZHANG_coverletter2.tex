\noindent {Dear Professor Moin,}

I am writing to apply for the post-doc position within the Center of Turbulence Research at Stanford University.    Currently I am a research associate under the supervision of Professor Daniel J. Bodony in the Aerospace Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I already received my Ph.D. degree in May, 2014, and should be available anytime from now.   

My Ph.D. research focuses on sound-induced flows and turbulence studies which are widely applied in industry.   Through high fidelity numerical simulations and mathematical modeling I investigated the fundamental flow features generated by the honeycomb acoustic liners under a grazing turbulent boundary layer. Some of the novel ideas were highly appreciated by NASA senior research scientists.   Reports on these efforts have appeared, or are to appear, in numerous archival journals.   I also gave several formal talks at AIAA and APS conferences.   

My postdoc research activities involves the entropic noise sources in a single stage low-pressure turbine.   The moving grid and high order interpolation techniques I use allow me to perform simulations in a more complex but industrial desired geometries.   In addition to being used to explore the process of sound generation, the numerical databases are aiding development of reduced-order models for future researchers.   I was also deeply involved in the jet-cross-flow simulation for the proposal of PSAAP2 center application at University of Illinois.    I have also extensive experience in supersonic nozzle jet simulation and subsonic transient jet simulation.  

Beyond these focuses my research interests are broad so that branching into other areas is expected.   For example, I am interested in supporting work in multiscale and multi physics simulations, including multiphase flows.  I am also interested in the fundamental studies of the turbulence geometries as well.  Additional research topics, and a deeper discussion of those mentioned here, are covered in my research statement. 

Attached please find my Curriculum Vitae, a list of references and research statement.    Should you or the Center require more information, please contact me without hesitation.  I can be reached most easily via my e-email address.  Thank you for considering this application and I look forward to future correspondence.
