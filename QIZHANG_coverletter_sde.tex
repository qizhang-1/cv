\noindent {Dear Hiring manager,}

I am currently working at Institute of Computational Sciences at the \emph{University of Texas at Austin}.   I am respectfully submitting the enclosed resume for my application to the \position position at \company.  

I received my Ph.D. degree from the \emph{University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign} with a focus on large-scale parallel simulations.   During my Ph.D studies, I developed extensive experience in writing productive codes using different programming languages (Java, C, C++, Python and Fortran) for supercomputing environments.   I dedicated years in establishing new reduced order models for complex acoustic problems via rigorous statistical analysis.   As a software engineer and research associate at the University of Texas at Austin, I actively got involved in the machine learning approach for turbulence modeling with collaboration with the scientists at the Sandia National Laboratory.     I kept myself updated with the trend of objective oriented programming, large data manipulation and machine learning skills via Coursera and I am also actively competing at Kaggle for various machine learning projects that match my interests.    I believe that my solid technical background and strong motivation make me an ideal candidate for this position. 

 I've enclosed my resume and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my credentials.   Please let me if you need additional information.   Thank you for your time and consideration.
