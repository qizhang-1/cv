\noindent {Dear hiring manager,}

I am currently working at Institute of Computational Sciences at the \emph{University of Texas at Austin}.   I am respectfully submitting the enclosed resume for my application at \company. %to the \position position at \company.  

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Aerospace Engineering Department at the \emph{University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign} with a focus on large-scale parallel simulations in computational acoustics.   I have extensive experience in writing large scale codes using different languages (C/C++, Python, Java and Fortran) for supercomputing environments.  After graduation I collaborated with Dr. Moser at the Institute of Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, where I lead in developing, maintaining the SU2 code and implementing multiple unit tests to make the code faster and more robust.   Our highly-scaled code running up to 100,000 cores on Stampede cluster can rapidly provide sufficient high-fidelity simulation data for the Sandia National Lab for their machine learning studies in better turbulence modeling.  

I believe my solid skills makes me an ideal candidate for this position at \company.    I greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with most intelligent people at \company\text{ }because I know everyone here can be my lifetime mentor and I hope one day in the near future I can be among one of you.   Please let me if you need additional information and I am sincerely looking forward to your reply.
